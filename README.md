# 📘 Numerical Techniques in MATLAB — EEE282 Inspired

This repository is a personal collection of MATLAB scripts and functions that explore core numerical methods used in engineering. While inspired by the EEE282 Numerical Techniques Lab at BRAC University, this is **not an official course repository**. I created it to deepen my own understanding, help others learn, and keep everything in one place for future reference.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

- 🧠 To reinforce my learning through hands-on coding
- 📚 To help fellow students and self-learners grasp numerical techniques
- 🛠️ To provide ready-to-run MATLAB examples for common engineering problems
- 🗂️ To organize all experiments in a clean, modular structure

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a major topic or experiment:

| Folder Name                                  | Description                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CurveFitting_Linear_Polynomial_Regression/` | Linear, polynomial, and universal regression techniques       |
| `AllAboutTable/`                             | Table creation and student data manipulation                  |
| _(More folders coming soon)_                 | Differentiation, integration, ODEs, nonlinear equations, etc. |

## 🚀 How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaziAbdurRahim/EEE282_Numerical_Techniques_Matlab.git
```

````

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder of interest.
2. Run the scripts or call the functions with your own data.
3. Explore, modify, and experiment freely.
