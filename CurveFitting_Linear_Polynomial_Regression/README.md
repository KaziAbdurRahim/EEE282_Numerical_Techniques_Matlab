## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to this folder.
2. Run any of the scripts (`CurveFittingLinear.m`, `CurveFittingPoly.m`, etc.) to see regression plots.
3. Use the function files (`linear_regression.m`, etc.) in your own projects or assignments.
4. Modify `Practices.m` to experiment with different datasets and regression orders.

## ðŸ“Œ Tips for Students

- Use `universal_poly_regression.m` when you want flexibility in choosing the polynomial order.
- Compare results from `linear_regression.m` and `second_order_regression.m` to understand model accuracy.
- Try plotting residuals to evaluate the goodness of fit.
- Use `Practices.m` to test your understanding with custom inputs.
